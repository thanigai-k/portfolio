## Challenges

The Calendar felt stuck in the past—no timezone smarts, clunky UX, and poor performance in dynamic views. Customizing styles was a headache, holding teams back from building fast, modern experiences.

## Solution

We gave the Calendar a full makeover—inside and out. Added a clean month picker, built-in timezone support, and lazy rendering for better performance. Introduced a flexible styling API with support for classNames, styles, and tokens—so teams can customize with ease. Wrapped it all in clean hooks and context to keep things testable, accessible, and developer-friendly.

### Impact Created

- Cut Calendar load time in tabbed views by **60%** through lazy rendering and conditional mounts.
- Rolled out a consistent Calendar experience across **3+ platforms**—desktop, mobile, and embedded apps.
- Boosted internal developer adoption by **40%**, thanks to simplified APIs, clear docs, and usage examples.
- Established a reusable styling pattern now adopted in **5+ components** including Tabs, Tooltips, and Inputs.

## Reflections

This project helped me deepen my understanding of date handling, timezones, and accessibility-first component design. It also reinforced the value of collaborative iteration across design, engineering, and QA when building foundational system components.

It’s a reminder that even utility-driven components like calendars can be complex—but when done right, they become powerful tools that empower product teams to ship faster with consistency.

The improved Calendar is now live across multiple micro frontends in production, and the learnings are influencing how we evolve the rest of our design system
